# Doodleflow

## Description
Drawing App built with NextJS for UI, Firebase for Auth, TypeScript for type safety and WebSockets for Realtime drawing updates.

## Features
- Realtime Collaboration
- Secure Authentication & Authorization Mechanism
- Board Persistence
- Reactive Board Elements

# PLEASE NOTE
Please note due to limited time there are two meager features that were passed (but still work with patches) to focus on more important features, they are listed below;
1. Clearing board: A suboptimal substitute for this is to resize the browser tab.
2. List of online collaborators on mobile phones: This feature works but it only exists on wider screens from tablets upwards.
As was aforementioned these features do not fully work but have patches and can definitely work completely in the future.
