## Description
Drawing Collaboration App built with NextJS for UI, Firebase for Auth, TypeScript for type safety, and WebSockets for Real-time drawing updates.

## Technology Stack

- **NextJS for UI:** Leveraging the power of React, NextJS provides a smooth and efficient user interface for seamless drawing collaboration.

- **Firebase for Authentication:** Ensure secure and reliable user authentication using Firebase, allowing users to sign in with various methods such as email/password, Google, or other supported providers.

- **TypeScript for Type Safety:** Benefit from the advantages of TypeScript to catch and prevent potential bugs early in the development process, enhancing code maintainability and collaboration.

- **WebSockets for Real-time Drawing Updates:** Implement WebSockets to facilitate real-time communication between users, enabling instant updates and synchronization of drawing changes. This ensures a fluid and collaborative drawing experience.

## Features

### 1. Real-time Collaboration

- **Instant Updates:** Changes made by one user are immediately broadcasted to all collaborators, ensuring everyone is on the same page in real-time.

- **Join-in Progress:** Users joining the collaboration, even after changes have been made, can catch up by viewing all previous changes. This feature ensures a cohesive and inclusive collaborative environment.

- **User Presence:** Display real-time user presence indicators, showing who is currently active on the board.

- **Mobile Compatibility:** Extend the application's compatibility to mobile devices, allowing users to collaborate on the go.


### 2. Secure Authentication & Authorization Mechanism

- **Firebase Authentication:** Utilize Firebase authentication for a secure and reliable sign-in process, supporting multiple authentication providers for user convenience.

- **Authorization Controls:** Implement role-based authorization to control access levels and permissions, ensuring a secure and controlled collaboration space.

### 3. Board Persistence

- **Persistent Boards:** Save and retrieve board states, allowing users to continue their collaborative drawings across sessions. This feature enhances the user experience by providing continuity and the ability to revisit and edit boards.

### 4. Reactive Board Elements

- **Dynamic Elements:** Implement reactive board elements that respond to user actions in real-time, creating a dynamic and engaging drawing experience.

- **Interactive Tools:** Provide a variety of drawing tools and features that users can interact with collaboratively, enhancing creativity and collaboration.

## Future Enhancements

- **Version Control:** Introduce version control for boards, allowing users to track changes over time and revert to previous states.

- **Export and Share:** Enable users to export and share their collaborative creations with others, fostering a sense of community and creativity.
